# Round Robin CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview
This project simulates the Round Robin (RR) CPU scheduling algorithm in Python. It demonstrates how different time quantum values impact performance metrics like CPU utilization, throughput, waiting time, and turnaround time.

## Features
- Simulates Round Robin scheduling with custom time quantum values.
- Calculates performance metrics to analyze scheduling efficiency.
- Includes visual analysis of results for different time quantum values.

## Repository Contents
- **RoundRobin_Simulator.py**: Python script for the simulation.
- **processes.csv**: Sample input file with process details.
- **RoundRobin_Report.pdf**: Detailed project report, including:
  - Introduction to CPU scheduling and the Round Robin algorithm.
  - Implementation details and instructions for running the simulation.
  - Performance analysis with visual results.
